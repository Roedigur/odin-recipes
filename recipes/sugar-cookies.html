        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line pans with cupcake liners.</li>
       <li>Sift cake mix into a small bowl and set aside.</li>
       <li>In a large bowl, combine eggs, oil, vanilla extract, milk and sour cream until smooth.</li>
       <li>Stir in cake mix.</li>
       <li>Fill cupcake liners 3/4 full and bake for 16-20 minutes or until an inserted knife comes out clean.</li>
       <li>Let cool.</li>
       <li>Chocolate frosting: Beat butter. Add cocoa powder, 2 C. powdered sugar and milk. Slowly add more powdered sugar until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
       <li>Prep reindeer "faces" by using frosting to stick brown M&M's on Nilla Wafers (some red for Rudolphs if you want). Melt down a few chocolate chips, put in a small plastic bag, snip off the tip to make a mini piping bag and "dot" little eyeballs on the white M&M's to make eyes.</li>
       <li>Frost cupcakes.</li>
       <li>(See photos above) Place Nilla wafers with M&M's on cupcakes, then place pretzels above. Use a little frosting to stick on 2 eyes and there you go!</li>
    </ol>

    <em>Optional:</em>
    <a>Decorate the sugar cookies by adding icing to them and adding sprinkles.</a>
    
    <p><strong><em>Tip: You can use christmas shaped cookie cutters to make the sugar cookies look even better!</em></strong></p>
