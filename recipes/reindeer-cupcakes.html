            <li>White Mint M&M's</li>        
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line pans with cupcake liners.</li>
            <li>Sift cake mix into a small bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine eggs, oil, vanilla extract, milk and sour cream until smooth.</li>
            <li>Stir in cake mix.</li>
            <li>Fill cupcake liners 3/4 full and bake for 16-20 minutes or until an inserted knife comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Let cool.</li>
            <li>Chocolate frosting: Beat butter. Add cocoa powder, 2 C. powdered sugar and milk. Slowly add more powdered sugar until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Prep reindeer "faces" by using frosting to stick brown M&M's on Nilla Wafers (some red for Rudolphs if you want). Melt down a few chocolate chips, put in a small plastic bag, snip off the tip to make a mini piping bag and "dot" little eyeballs on the white M&M's to make eyes.</li>
            <li>Frost cupcakes.</li>
            <li>(See photos above) Place Nilla wafers with M&M's on cupcakes, then place pretzels above. Use a little frosting to stick on 2 eyes and there you go!</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong><em>Tip: You can use red M&M's to make make the red nose of Rudolf!</em></strong></p>
    
        <p>And that's all you need to make you're own reindeer cupcakes. Hopefully they turned out good!</p>
